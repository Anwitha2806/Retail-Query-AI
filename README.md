Retail Query AI
Overview
Retail Query AI is a Streamlit application designed to allow users to query a MySQL database using natural language. The application utilizes a large language model (LLM) to interpret user queries, convert them into SQL, and return the results from the database.

Features
Natural Language Processing: Users can enter queries in simple language, which are then converted into SQL queries.
Database Connection: Connects to a MySQL database using pymysql.
Query Execution: Executes the generated SQL queries and returns the results.
Streamlit Interface: Provides a user-friendly web interface for interaction.
Requirements
To run this project, you need to have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Streamlit
LangChain
PyMySQL
Hugging Face Transformers
Chroma
Llama 3.1 instance from Groq
Any additional dependencies specified in requirements.txt
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/retail-query-ai.git
cd retail-query-ai
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your database:

Ensure you have a MySQL database named estore_tshirts.
Update the database connection parameters in connect_db() function if necessary.
Set your environment variables:

Set your Groq API key:
bash
Copy code
export groq_api_key='your_groq_api_key'  # On Windows use `set`
Usage
Run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run main.py
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501.

Enter your query in the input field and press Enter. The app will generate the corresponding SQL query and display the results.

Code Structure
main.py: The main application file containing the Streamlit interface and logic for handling user input.
langchain_helper.py: Helper functions for connecting to the database, creating the LLM model, finding SQL queries, and converting results.
requirements.txt: Lists the required packages for the project.
Functions
connect_db(): Connects to the MySQL database using specified credentials.
create_llm_model(): Creates and returns a language model instance for processing queries.
find_sql_query(response): Extracts the SQL query from the response generated by the LLM.
convert_number(result): Cleans and formats the query result before display.
